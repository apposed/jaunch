The ImageJ Launcher (a.k.a. the Fiji Launcher) program has been replaced with a
new launcher named Jaunch.

I made a concerted effort to preserve backward compatibility as much as
possible. As such, most features of the previous launcher still work in the
same manner.

However, the following features of the ImageJ Launcher are no longer supported:

* No longer supports launching in "Fiji1" mode (fiji.Main).

* No longer supports launching in "IJ1" mode without ImageJ2 support.
  A separate `imagej` launcher configuration now exists for this use case.
  But it does not use the ImageJ.cfg file; you must edit imagej.toml.

* No longer supports launching versions of ImageJ2 before 2.0.0-beta-8
  (released 2014-05-16) when the component+package structure was finalized.

* TODO: Decide about all the various `net.imagej.launcher.*` features...
