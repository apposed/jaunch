# 1. The --headless option configures Jaunch to pass the flag -Djava.awt.headless=true
#    to the JVM. This makes it friendlier for CLI users to launch your application in
#    headless mode, without knowing anything about the Java platform specifically.
#
# 2. Similarly, --heap=1234m (aliased also to --mem and --memory) will be transformed
#    into a -Xmx1234m argument to the JVM, so that users have an easier-to-remember
#    option for setting the max heap size, without memorizing Java's -Xmx terminology.
#
# (In both of these examples, the transformations described are defined within the
# jvm.runtime-args section toward the bottom of the file. Be patient, we'll get there!)

#
# The asterisk wildcard symbol (*) is allowed as a suffix,
# if you want to match all arguments with a particular prefix.
#
# About main arguments: Jaunch's philosophy is to remain agnostic of the options
# your application supports, rather than trying to constrain them in its configuration
# and checking them itself. As such, it is your application's responsibility to emit
# error messages as appropriate if it encounters displeasing arguments.
#
# For example, suppose the user invokes:
#
#     ./fizzbuzz 1 2 3 4 5 -Xms1g 
#
# Because '-X*' is on the jvm.recognized-args list out of the box,
# Jaunch will translate this invocation to:
#
#     java -Xms1g org.fizzbuzz.FizzBuzz 1 2 3 4 5
#
# Even though the Java argument appears after the main arguments. Users can mix
# and match to their hearts' content, being as sloppy as they want, and Jaunch will
# sort out the mess. As long as the JVM args are on the list here, of course.

# ==============================================================================
# jvm.allow-weird-runtimes
# ==============================================================================
# Whether to attempt to launch with mysterious flavors of the JVM.
#
# When Jaunch discovers a Java installation on the user's system, it tries very hard
# to understand the details of that installation, including Java version, distribution
# (see `jvm.distros-allowed` and `jvm.distros-blocked` below), operating system, and
# CPU architecture, so that it can respect the constraints defined in this config file.
#
# However, the variability across JVM distributions is actually quite a lot:
#
# * The vast majority of distros include a file named 'release' with important metadata
#   fields inside. But a few distros are missing that file (e.g. Corretto 1.8.0_265-b01
#   for x64 Linux), and a few others are missing needed metadata fields (e.g. Liberica
#   1.8.0_392 for x64 Linux, which is missing IMPLEMENTOR), or they might put something
#   stupid as a value (e.g. JBRSDK 11.0.6 for x64 Linux, which has IMPLEMENTOR="N/A").
#
# * For that reason, Jaunch also parses the directory name of the installation, trying
#   to extract this information. But the naming schemes across distro are also very
#   diverse and sometimes uninformative: e.g. JBRSDK 11.0.6 for x64 Linux, which has the
#   vague folder name of "jbrsdk" with no version, or JBRSDK 11.0.8 for x64 Linux, which
#   has the nested folder name "jbrsdk_11.0.8_x64/jbr" making the final directory name
#   "jbr" still with no version, or JBRSDK 8 for Linux, which has no directory prefix at
#   all. And of course users and packaging scripts can rename the JVM root directory to
#   anything, corrupting this information in the process.
#
# * As a final measure, when needed, Jaunch invokes the Java installation's bin/java on
#   a small Java program that prints out all key=value pairs of System.getProperties(),
#   paying particular attention to java.version, java.vendor, and java.vendor.version.
#   This is the slowest but most reliable way to gather metadata about an installation.
#   But it's not a guaranteed solution either: for example, JVMs bundled up by jpackage
#   are placed in a lib/runtime directory without a bin folder! So no bin/java.
#
# As such, it is possible for all of Jaunch's efforts to be in vain, and to end up
# trying to decide whether to launch with some mystery-flavored JVM. In such scenarios,
# the jvm.allow-weird-runtimes flag comes to the rescue, telling Jaunch whether to allow
# it (true), or give up and complain (false). Hopefully, your users will never know the
# difference, as long as they have well-behaved distros, and/or you ship a good distro
# with your application. But just in case, give a think to how you want this to behave.

jvm.allow-weird-runtimes = true

# ==============================================================================
# jvm.version-min, jvm.version-max
# ==============================================================================
# Acceptable range of Java versions to match.
#
# These two fields let you constrain the minimum and maximum Java versions respectively
# that your application supports. This information will be used when searching the
# system for appropriate JVM installations. If a JVM is successfully discovered, but
# then found to be outside these constraints, it is discarded and the search continues.
# For installations whose version cannot be determined, what Jaunch does will depend on
# the jvm.allow-weird-runtimes boolean setting above.
#
# The most common use of these fields is to specify major versions alone (e.g.
# `jvm.version-min = '11'`), but Jaunch does make a best effort to compare version
# strings digit by digit, so you could try `jvm.version-min = '1.8.0.101'` if you
# like to live dangerously. YMMV, though.
#
# "But what syntax exactly should I use to specify these versions?" you might wonder.
# Excellent question! To answer that, let's have some background:
#
# As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
# Never has that belief been put into action more fervently than it has with the Java
# versioning scheme, which has a fraught and confusing history:
#
# * The first stable release of Java, 1.0.2, was also called Java 1.
#
# * The 1.2 release was marketed as the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE).
#
# * The 1.5 release was marketed as Java SE 5, with a "developer version" of 1.5
#   and a "product version" of 5.0.
#
# * This dual versioning scheme continued through versions 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8,
#   which were also known as 6, 7 and 8 respectively -- although the '1.' prefix
#   (at least in my anecdotal experience) decreased in prominence over time.
#
# * There is also a baffling convention that Java 8 specifically uses where
#   version 1.8.0_XYZ -- which is also written as 8.0_XYZ or 8.0.XYZ -- is
#   frequently expressed as 8uXYZ.
#
# * With the release of Java 9, the '1.' prefix was finally officially dropped.
#
# * Nonetheless, for backwards compatibility with old assumptions, you might still
#   see a '1.' here or there, such as the /usr/lib/jvm folder on Debian/Ubuntu.
#

# Who knows what (if anything) this table proves, but it's probably Numberwang!
#
# So back to the key question: what numbers should you write for the min and max?
# Use the so-called "developer version" in all cases, with dots only as separators:
#
# * For Java 8 and earlier, prepend the '1.' portion.
# * For Java 9 and later, don't.
#
# So if you want 1.8.0_101 (a.k.a. 8u101), write '1.8.0.101', not '8.0.101'.
# If you want 11.0.8, write '11.0.8', not '1.11.0.8'.
#
# As a kindness, when Jaunch sees a major version digit less than 9, it prepends the
# '1.' prefix on your behalf. So you can write e.g. `jvm.version-min = '8'` if you
# really want to. Jaunch also strips the '1.' leading digit when the subsequent minor
# version digit is 9 or more. So write '1.11.0.8' if you must! But know that in doing
# so, you stand opposed to the hallowed official versioning scheme, a heretic in the
# eyes of Java developers everywhere. You have been warned!

#jvm.version-min = '8' # hobgoblin!
#jvm.version-max = '21'

# An asterisk (*) means that that metadata field, and/or the release file itself, is

# ==============================================================================
# Developer aside: Right now, Jaunch only filters Java installations by distro,
# version, OS, and CPU arch. But there are further criteria it could support:
#
# * Java Development Kit (JDK) vs. Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
# * Availability of optional features such as CRaC or JavaFX/OpenJFX.
# * Minimum and/or maximum versions of operating systems (Windows 11+).
# * More complex version filtering rules, e.g. multiple version exclusion ranges.
#
# Implementing such additional criteria will be done according to user demand.
# If you need these, open an issue: https://github.com/scijava/jaunch/issues/new

# ==============================================================================
# jvm.root-paths
# ==============================================================================
# Paths to check for Java installations.
#
# This is a list of directories where Jaunch might hope to find a Java installation.
# Directories are checked sequentially until one is found that matches all criteria.
#
# This is also the first field where we see Jaunch's hints/rules system in action.
# Each entry on the root-dirs list may be prefixed with string separated by pipes.
# Each segment is a *hint* for Jaunch regarding a flag that must be set for that
# particular line to be considered. Jaunch sets hint flags based on a few sources:
#
# * Active operating system: OS:LINUX, OS:MACOSX, OS:WINDOWS,
#   OS:IOS, OS:ANDROID, OS:WASM, OS:TVOS, OS:WATCHOS, or OS:UNKNOWN.
#
# * Active CPU architecture: ARCH:ARM32, ARCH:ARM64, ARCH:X86, ARCH:X64,
#   ARCH:MIPS32, ARCH:MIPSEL32, ARCH:WASM32, or ARCH:UNKNOWN.
#
# * Option hints, set from arguments passed to Jaunch, each of which sets a matching
#   hint. For example, passing the --headless option will set a hint '--headless'.
#
# * Mode hints, set from evaluation of the modes field (see common.toml).
#
# * Java hints, based on the Java installation selected:
#   - JAVA:8 if the selected Java installation is version 8.
#   - JAVA:8+ if the selected Java installation is version 8 or later.
#   - JAVA:9 if the selected Java installation is version 9.
#   - JAVA:9+ if the selected Java installation is version 9 or later.
#   - and so on.
#   Of course, Java hints will only be set after a Java installation matches,
#   so they won't work here in jvm.root-paths, nor in jvm.lib-suffixes.
#   But they can be useful in the jvm.runtime-args section to ensure Jaunch
#   passes JVM args only to those versions of the JVM that support them, such
#   as the JPMS-related flags like --add-opens which were introduced in Java 9.
#
# Finally, a segment prefixed by a bang symbol (!) negates the hint,
# making that line match only when that particular hint is *not* set.
#
# For example, consider the following jvm.root-paths line:
#
#     '!--system|OS:LINUX|ARCH:X64|${app-dir}/java/linux64/*',
#
# The applicable hints are !--system, OS:LINUX, and ARCH:X64, so the root path of
# ${app-dir}/java/linux64/* will only be considered on 64-bit Linux systems, and
# only when the --system option was *not* given as part of the launcher invocation.
#
# This is also the first field where we see Jaunch's variables in use:
#
#     '--java-home|${java-home}'
#
# Thanks to the above line, when the user passes '--java-home=/the-best-jdk', the
# --java-home hint will be set, and the java-home variable will be set to /the-best-jdk.
# So not only will the line match, but the root path to check will become /the-best-jdk.
# 
# Similarly, variable expressions are also sourced from environment variables, so
# the '${JAVA_HOME}' line will be populated with the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

# ==============================================================================
# Developer aside: Right now, Jaunch does not utilize any programmatic ways
# to discover Java root directories. But it could! In particular:
#
# - Windows: look for registry keys
# - macOS: /usr/libexec/java_home -V
# - Linux: /usr/sbin/update-java-alternatives -l
#
# We could invent schema elements for toggling use of these detection approaches.
# But for now: YAGNI! File an issue or a pull request if you do need it.

# ==============================================================================
# jvm.lib-suffixes
# ==============================================================================
# List of places within a Java installation to look for the JVM library.
#
# For example, if the root directory currently being considered is
# /the-best-jvm, and the current libjvm suffix line is lib/server/libjvm.so,
# then Jaunch will check the path /the-best-jvm/lib/server/libjvm.so for the
# library. If found, we have a winning Java installation!
#
# For macOS, the reason to prefer libjli.dylib over libjvm.dylib is that if
# one dynamically loads libjvm.dylib via dlopen(), macOS helpfully pops up a
# dialog box instructing the user to install Apple Java 6. At least: it did
# so for many years, including for several OS versions where Apple Java 6 no
# longer functioned properly. While it is possible that Apple has since changed
# this problematic behavior, we keep using libjli.dylib because it still works,
# and definitely avoids the problem on systems where that behavior is present.
# Related reading: https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8064542
#
# Finally, perusing the list below, you may notice several entries beginning
# with jre/. This nested folder is only present up to Java 8, nothing after.

# The asterisk wildcard symbol (*) is allowed, if you want to match all JAR files,

# The double-asterisk (**) for recursive matching is not yet implemented,

# - For 48 GB: '48g'
# - For 75% of available RAM: '75%'
# - For 3 GB less than available RAM: '-3g'

# If unset, Java's default will be used (i.e. no -Xmx argument will be injected).
