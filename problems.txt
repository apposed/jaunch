In decreasing order of severity:

The `${app-dir}` special variable is not yet populated.
It needs to be set to the directory containing the launcher executable.

The `--option=value` syntax does not work; you have to write `--option value`
as two separate arguments.

The --dry-run output on Windows works in Command Prompt, but not PowerShell,
because PowerShell gets weird about unquoted arguments with the dot (.) symbol.
Should the Windows --dry-run put double quotes around *every* argument? :-/

Jaunch's design treats options as a set, not a list. Therefore, order does not
matter, nor does Jaunch support repeat options. E.g., when passing an option
twice with different values (e.g. `--add a.jar --add b.jar`), the latter value
overwrites the former. A workaround is to use a style like `--add a.jar,b.jar`.
