In decreasing order of severity:

The native launcher on macOS, which typically would live in Contents/MacOS,
is currently too dumb to check `../..` for the Jaunch configuration.

The native launcher on Windows currently pops up a Command Prompt.

Right now, there are several files that must be in the application base
directory, including fizzbuzz.exe, jaunch.exe, jaunch.toml, fizzbuzz.toml, and
Props.class. It would be nice if there was an option to nest these into a
common subfolder such as jaunch or .jaunch.

The --dry-run output on Windows works in Command Prompt, but not PowerShell,
because PowerShell gets weird about unquoted arguments with the dot (.) symbol.
Should the Windows --dry-run put double quotes around each argument?

Jaunch's design treats options as a set, not a list. Therefore, order does not
matter, nor does Jaunch support repeat options. E.g., when passing an option
twice with different values (e.g. `--add a.jar --add b.jar`), the latter value
overwrites the former. A workaround is to use a style like `--add a.jar,b.jar`.
